# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that allows you to search up the current and 5-day forecast for cities across the globe. When you search a city, it's name, current date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index appear in the main section. The weather for the next five days will appear below it, with those day's dates, weather icons, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Your recent searches will be logged below the search bar and are available to search again if selected.
